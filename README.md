# Please Read This First !!

Hi front end developer, this repository is a prototype that I made for our app. From here you should be able to see the strcuture of app UI layout, as well as html/css styles. 

This prototype is still in early stage, which will keeping updating, and I truly hope that by sharing the code we could develop the app UI in a faster and more precise way.

If there is any mistake or problems about this prototype please talk to me, I'll appreciate if you can help to improve it.

In addition, if you are not front end developer for this app, you could open the **local prototype app** provided below.


## How to use

Most useful contents are in the src folder, first of all please go to the **global.scss** to view those universal styles, as well as basic page structure, you could find styles of font/buttons/containers and so on, I also wrote lots of comment in this file for you to understand.

In the **views** folder you can see the UI of 4 current pages, and some components are in **components** folder. 

**This prototype uses Vue, in page and component files you can view the "template" settion to see html structures, and in the "style" section you can see page level css code.**

## Local Prototype App

I packed the prototype into a windows app with Electron, here is the download link: https://lenovobeijing-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/liuzy32_lenovo_com/EbZckaO50iNCrlhbDiNpCG8B2ovMe5gTu6yy-NfBqEGkFw?e=2dCUCd

I'll try to keep this local prototype updated but it is expected if it is not.
